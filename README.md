# **WebMazza - BistroCafe** 🍴🍔🍹

The project is a _React-built_ landing page for a restaurant.

The website serves as online presence for the restaurant, giving visitors an aesthetically pleasing and easily accessible way for finding out on the business and its products. 💻 The website is completely responsive and mobile-friendly. The website is navigable and visually appealing thanks to the use of _Tailwind CSS_.

The website is made up of the following components: the _Header_ (which has a _navigation menu_ with links to the website's many sections), the _About_ section, the _Main Courses_ of the Menu, the _"Meet our Chef"_ section, the _Testimonials_ section, and the _Contact_ page.

**Note**: Buttons to deepen each section have been voluntarily disabled. The buttons will be activated once this project has been expanded to include insights from the other sections.

## Challenges and Learning 🤔💡

After studying the basis of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with this project, I started taking my first steps with React and Tailwind. I found this system very useful for business necessities, as I was able to build a customized project using a data.js file. This method can be applied to build other business models, starting from requests and data provided by the customer. This project also made me understand the importance of some aspects for SEO, such as the use of certain metatags.

## Future Improvements 🚧

Expand the project by going deeper into each section and add a back-end side for the reservation system.
